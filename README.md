Problem Statement

Logistics in Sub-Saharan Africa increases the cost of manufactured goods by up to 320%; while in Europe, it only accounts for up to 90% of the manufacturing cost. Sendy is a business-to-business platform established in 2014, to enable businesses of all types and sizes to transport goods more efficiently across East Africa. The company is headquartered in Kenya with a team of more than 100 staff, focused on building practical solutions for Africaâ€™s dynamic transportation needs, from developing apps and web solutions to providing dedicated support for goods on the move.

Sendy has hired you to help predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at the final destination. Build a model that predicts an accurate delivery time, from picking up a package arriving at the final destination. An accurate arrival time prediction will help all business to improve their logistics and communicate the accurate time their time to their customers. You will be required to perform various feature engineering techniques while preparing your data for further analysis.
